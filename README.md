### Hi there üëã I'm Albara Mustafa!

A passionate **Team Leader / Senior Software Engineer** with a strong track record of building scalable, high-performance solutions. I thrive on architecting robust systems, leading cross-functional teams, and fostering a culture of clean code and continuous technical growth.

### üöÄ About Me

My mission is to craft elegant, efficient, and maintainable software that solves real-world problems. I'm deeply committed to **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring long-term project health and adaptability.

As a **Team Leader**, I lead and mentor development teams, driving projects from conception to successful deployment. As a **Senior Software Engineer**, I specialize in designing and implementing **microservices** and **modular monolithic** architectures using **ASP.NET Core** and **Flutter**. I'm skilled at integrating complex systems and managing **API gateways** to streamline communication. My expertise spans developing versatile applications, from **multi-tenant e-commerce platforms** and **real-time inventory systems** to **Warehouse Management (WMS)** and **ERP solutions**.

I'm all about clean code, robust design patterns (Factory, Observer, Decorator), and staying at the forefront of technology through continuous learning.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Technical Expertise

My journey as a software engineer has equipped me with a robust and versatile technical toolkit. I primarily craft robust backend solutions using **C#** and the **.NET Core** ecosystem, leveraging frameworks like **ASP.NET MVC** and **Razor Pages** for web development, and integrating with advanced libraries such as **EF Core**, **Dapper**, **Mapster**, **SignalR**, **JWT**, and **MediatR** to build high-performance APIs. For data persistence, I'm adept with **PostgreSQL**, **MS SQL**, and NoSQL databases like **MongoDB**.

On the frontend, I bring ideas to life with **Flutter** using **Dart**, creating intuitive cross-platform mobile experiences, expertly managing state with patterns like **Provider**, **Riverpod**, **BLoC**, and **GetX**, and styling interfaces with **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**. I consistently apply principles of **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, along with patterns like **Microservices**, **Modular Monolithic**, **CQRS**, and the **Repository/Specification Patterns**, to ensure my solutions are scalable, maintainable, and resilient. My workflow is streamlined with **Git**, **Docker**, **RESTful APIs**, and tools like **Swagger/OpenAPI** and **Postman**. I also have experience with **Python** for machine learning integrations and have worked with **Java** for native Android development, alongside cloud platforms like **Google Cloud Platform (APIs)**.
